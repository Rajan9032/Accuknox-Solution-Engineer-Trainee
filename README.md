1.Top 5 Kubernetes Security attack vectors

Kubernetes, a powerful container orchestration platform, is widely used but also presents several security challenges. Here are the top 5 Kubernetes security attack vectors.
1.	Misconfigured Access Control and RBAC (Role-Based Access Control):
                 Description: Improperly configured access controls can lead to unauthorized                                            access to Kubernetes clusters. If RBAC policies are too permissive, it can allow users or   service accounts to perform actions beyond their intended scope.
                 Mitigation: Ensure RBAC policies follow the principle of least privilege, regularly review and update policies, and use tools to audit and enforce these policies.

2.	Unpatched Kubernetes Components:

•          Description : Running outdated versions of Kubernetes and its components (e.g., kube-apiserver, kube-scheduler, etc.) can expose clusters to known vulnerabilities.
•          Mitigation : Regularly update Kubernetes and its components to the latest stable versions, and monitor for and apply security patches promptly.

3.	Container Image Vulnerabilities :
               Description: Containers built from images with known vulnerabilities can be exploited by attackers to gain control of the container or the host system.
               Mitigation: Use trusted base images, regularly scan container images for vulnerabilities using tools like Clair or Trivy, and apply security patches to the images.
•  
4.	Network Security Issues :
                      •  Description: Insecure network configurations can lead to issues like network eavesdropping, unauthorized access to services, and lateral movement within the cluster.
•                    Mitigation: Implement network policies to control traffic between pods, use network segmentation, encrypt data in transit, and employ service meshes like Istio for enhanced network security.

5.	Insecure Secrets Management :
         •  Description: Improper handling of sensitive information, such as credentials and API keys, can lead to unauthorized access and data breaches.
•          Mitigation: Use Kubernetes Secrets to manage sensitive information, encrypt secrets at rest and in transit, restrict access to secrets, and consider using external secret management tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager.

Problem Statement-2
Deploying a local Kubernetes (k8s) cluster and setting up the DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application) involves several steps. Here's a step-by-step guide to achieve this, along with a demonstration of three attack vectors.
Step 1: Set Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster
You can use Minikube to set up a local Kubernetes cluster. Minikube is a tool that runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your local machine.
Install Minikube
Follow the instructions for your operating system from the Minikube installation guide.
Start Minikube
bash
Copy command :
minikube start --driver=virtualbox
Step 2: Deploy DVWA on Kubernetes
DVWA is a PHP/MySQL web application that is designed to be vulnerable to a wide range of attacks, making it an excellent tool for security training.
Create a Kubernetes Deployment and Service for DVWA
Create a file named dvwa-deployment.yaml with the following content:
yaml
Copy yaml script :
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: dvwa
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: dvwa
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: dvwa
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: dvwa
        image: vulnerables/web-dvwa
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: dvwa
spec:
  selector:
    app: dvwa
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
Apply the deployment and service:
bash
Copy command
kubectl apply -f dvwa-deployment.yaml
Step 3: Access DVWA
Get the URL to access DVWA:
bash
Copy command :
minikube service dvwa --url
Open the URL in your browser to access the DVWA application.
Step 4: Demonstrate Attack Vectors
Here are three common attack vectors you can demonstrate:
1. SQL Injection
•	Navigate to the "SQL Injection" section.
•	Enter a typical SQL injection string like ' OR '1'='1 in the input field and submit.
•	Observe how the application behaves, indicating a successful SQL injection if it displays more data than intended.
2. Command Injection
•	Navigate to the "Command Injection" section.
•	Enter a command injection string like ; ls or ; cat /etc/passwd in the input field and submit.
•	Check if the application executes the command and returns the output, demonstrating a successful command injection.
3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
•	Navigate to the "XSS (Reflected)" section.
•	Enter a typical XSS payload like <script>alert('XSS')</script> in the input field and submit.
•	If the script executes and displays an alert, it indicates a successful XSS attack.
Conclusion
Following these steps will help you set up a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube, deploy the DVWA application, and demonstrate three common attack vectors. Ensure that you understand the security implications and conduct such activities in a controlled and ethical manner.
